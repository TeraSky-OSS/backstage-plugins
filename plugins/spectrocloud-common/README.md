# spectrocloud-common

Welcome to the SpectroCloud common library!

[![npm latest version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@terasky/backstage-plugin-spectrocloud-common/latest.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@terasky/backstage-plugin-spectrocloud-common)

The `spectrocloud-common` library provides shared types, interfaces, permission definitions, and utilities used by the SpectroCloud frontend and backend plugins. This is not added to a Backstage instance directly; it is a dependency of the other SpectroCloud plugins.
