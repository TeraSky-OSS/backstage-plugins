The `scaleops-frontend` plugin for Backstage displays data from ScaleOps regarding Kubernetes entities on your component. It shows potential and realized savings and can provide a link to the ScaleOps dashboard for more specific and broader data points. This plugin supports a single ScaleOps endpoint but does support multi-cluster features in ScaleOps allowing for end-to-end visibility.
