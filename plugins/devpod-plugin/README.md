Welcome to the devpod plugin!

[![npm latest version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@terasky/backstage-plugin-devpod/latest.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@terasky/backstage-plugin-devpod)

The `devpod` plugin for Backstage adds a grid item on the overview tab of components allowing for an "Open in Devpod" button. It supports allowing the user to choose the IDE it should open with and also provides the CLI command the user could run to open it up from the command line.
