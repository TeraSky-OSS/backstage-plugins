The `kyverno-policy-reports` frontend plugin for Backstage provides visibility into the Kyverno policy reports associated with a component. This plugin allows you to view policy reports, including details such as error counts, fail counts, pass counts, skip counts, and warning counts. It also provides a YAML viewer for each policy, including the ability to copy to clipboard the content or download the YAML file.
