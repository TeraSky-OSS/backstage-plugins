The `spectrocloud` frontend plugin for Backstage provides entity cards for visualizing SpectroCloud clusters and cluster profiles in your Backstage catalog. It displays cluster information including Kubernetes version, attached profiles, cloud type, and provides kubeconfig download functionality. For cluster profiles, it shows version information and tracks which clusters are using each profile version.
