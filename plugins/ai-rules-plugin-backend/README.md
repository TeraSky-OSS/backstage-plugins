The `AI Coding Rules Backend` plugin for Backstage provides the server-side functionality required to fetch and parse AI coding rules from Git repositories. It handles integration with Backstage's SCM integrations, parses various rule file formats, and exposes REST API endpoints for the frontend plugin to consume, supporting Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Cline rules with comprehensive content processing capabilities.
