## Overview

The Educates backend plugin provides the server-side functionality required to integrate Educates training portals with Backstage. It handles API communication, authentication, session management, and exposes endpoints for the frontend plugin to consume.

## Features

### API Integration
- Seamless communication with Educates training portals
- Support for multiple portal configurations
- Secure API token management
- Error handling and retries

### Authentication Management
- Token-based authentication
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure credential storage
- Session persistence

### Workshop Management
- Workshop catalog retrieval
- Workshop metadata handling
- Session creation and tracking

### Multi-Portal Support
- Multiple portal configurations out of the box

### Permission Framework
- Resource-based permission system
- Conditional permission rules
- Portal and workshop-specific access control
- Advanced permission conditions and decision making

## Permission Framework

The backend plugin provides a comprehensive permission framework with resource-based access control:

### Permission Resources

The plugin defines two main resource types:

- **Training Portal Resource (`educates-training-portal`)**
  - Controls access to specific training portals
  - Supports portal ownership and access rules

- **Workshop Resource (`educates-workshop`)**
  - Controls access to individual workshops
  - Supports workshop-specific permissions

### Permission Rules

#### Portal Permission Rules
- **`IS_PORTAL_OWNER`**: Grants access to users who own a training portal
- **`HAS_PORTAL_ACCESS`**: Grants access to users with specific portal permissions

#### Workshop Permission Rules
- **`IS_WORKSHOP_OWNER`**: Grants access to users who own a workshop
- **`HAS_WORKSHOP_ACCESS`**: Grants access to users with specific workshop permissions

### Conditional Permissions

The plugin supports conditional permission decisions through:

- **Portal Conditions**: Fine-grained portal access control
- **Workshop Conditions**: Workshop-specific permission logic
- **Decision Factories**: Programmatic permission decision creation
