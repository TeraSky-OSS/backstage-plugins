# AI Coding Rules Plugin

The AI Coding Rules plugin for Backstage provides comprehensive visualization and management of AI coding rules from various sources like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Cline, and Claude Code. It enables teams to discover, view, and manage their AI coding guidelines directly within the Backstage interface with clickable links to open rule files in their git repositories.

## Plugin Components

### Frontend Plugin
The frontend plugin provides a user interface for:

- Visualizing Cursor rules from `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` directories
- Displaying GitHub Copilot rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Showing Cline rules from `.clinerules/*.md` files
- Displaying Claude Code rules from `CLAUDE.md` files
- Manual filtering with configurable default rule types
- Clickable links to open rule files directly in git repositories
- Viewing rule metadata and content in expandable cards
- Statistics and overview of rule counts
- Apply Filter functionality for controlled rule searches

### Backend Plugin
The backend plugin handles:

- Integration with Backstage SCM integrations
- Fetching rules from Git repositories with retry logic and exponential backoff
- Parsing frontmatter metadata in rule files
- API endpoints for rule data retrieval
- Support for multiple rule types and formats
- Rate limiting protection for large repositories
- Multi-provider git support (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
